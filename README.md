                                    ** Machine Learning Code generator for Non Programmers **
                                         
This is a little project on top of outputty and matplotlib that aims in easily create plots (without  using matplotlib). For now you can    do linear, scatter and bar plots with data from CSV files.This program generates graphs from a given CSV file and allows the user to generate a User friendly graph
       
  **Requirements/Installations**
  
•	Execute pip install numpy matplotlib outputty

•	Download plotter

•	Unpack outputty and plotter in the same directory 

**Deployment**

The best way to deploy this software for use in lab is to run locally either through command prompt or a Python Interpreter of your own

**Sprint2 **

In the last sprint we completed convert data from CSV file into graphs. In Sprint2 we will Integrate graphical user inteface and connect a data base to the existing application. We will also add Tree graphs to the module.And add automate test to the existing code repository.
**Requirements **
The system must allow users to upload csv file 
The system must analyze the file containing the data by Machine learning program.
The system must allow users genrate graphs from the csv file uploaded.
The sytem must allow users to visualize the graphs generated.
The system must save the models generated by users such that only the user who created model should access and download that.
**Automation Testbed**
Pytest - We will implement automation testing using PyTest.
